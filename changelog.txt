Version: 1.2.0
  Features:
    - Some mods delete and re-create the player and their inventory under some circumstances which made SAS unable to find the armors in the cache based on their item number. Added a backup search for armor based on item name and grid contents to compensate for this.
    - Added a "clear color cache" key (default: Control + \) to delete the color cache as it can grow large in multiplayer or with lots of armors.
    - Updated Russian translation. I hope it's good!

  Bug Fixes:
    - Re-fixed crash when no armor equipped or no armor in inventory. Thanks to user sporefreak for discovering this.
